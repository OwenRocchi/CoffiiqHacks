# Coffii-QHacks-2021
Coffii Web Application for QHacks 2021

Inspiration 

COVID-19 has devastated our global society like never before, but above all, the shutdowns have substantially lowered our productivity levels. People miss the ambiance of the hustle and bustle, and yearn for the surge in productivity while working from coffee shops and public places. We strived to recreate that feeling, so you could enjoy the ambiance of your favourite places from the comfort of your home - enjoying the best of both worlds, right at your fingertips.

What It Does

Coffii is a web application that simulates the feeling of sitting inside your favourite coffee shops, restaurants, and public places. Go onto the map to search your favourite places to work from, then tune into its 360 degree live stream, and order your favourite drink/meal while you’re at it! Coffee chat and co-work at the virtual tables, and thrive just like the good old days! Whether you’re visiting your go-to café or traveling to a store across the world,  

How We Built It
We built Coffii using HTML/CSS and JavaScript, along with a Google Maps API.

Challenges We Ran Into

Our biggest challenge by far was optimizing our web layout for an intuitive design - spending hours of brainstorming, experimentation, and a bit of frustration - don’t worry, no keyboards were hurt :) Furthermore, we ran into some issues with the CSS and JavaScript, making sure the icons animated properly. 

Accomplishments that We’re Proud of

For all four of us, this was the most productive programming session we’ve ever done. Within two days, we tackled a dire need using a stimulating and user-friendly web application. Aside from our product, we realized how much our diverse expertise backgrounds strengthened our productivity and team chemistry - we will definitely be competing at the next QHacks together :)

What We Learned

Over the course of an intensive weekend, we learned how to optimize the user experience, while using JavaScript and CSS for the first time to animate our icon buttons. 

What’s Next for Coffii

Enhancing the animations to further simulate an in-person environment
Incorporating elements of virtual reality to engage our users more
Adding pomodoro timer feature or timed productivity reminders to get a coffee, take a break, etc.
